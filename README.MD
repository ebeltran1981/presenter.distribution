## Purpose of the Media Presenter

Sometimes it is time consuming to go a create a slideshow to present just images or videos for a public talk or any part in our meetings. This App tries to solve that problem, by simplifying the presentation of media in our screens. I have just tested this app with very few clickers. Feel free to use the __<a href="#">Issues</a>__ tab of GitHub located at the top of this page and submit your clicker codes for all the buttons.

### The Media Presenter has few versions:

#### 1) If have Windows 10, install it by going into Windows Store

</a>

#### 2) OR run it from the website version

This is the link to the web version of the Media Presenter: <a href="https://presenter.bmst.ws" target="_blank">Website</a>

#### 3) OR any other version of Windows, use the standalone version

You can download the __presenter.wpf.exe__ from the file list above. Considering this tool is free, and I haven't had the time and the resources to pay for a signing certificate that I must buy to be able to sign this software; Windows and your browser will warn you that it is risky to execute it. I hope at some point I will be able to sign it so that warning goes away, meanwhile, if you don't know me personally, I can only ask you to trust me! :grimacing:

#### Requirements to run the Media Presenter

To run the Media Presenter, your computer must have [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49981) installed. If your Windows 10 is up to date you should be good to go, if not, go to the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49981) and install it first.
